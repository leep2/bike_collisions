San Francisco is a great place to live if you don't have a car.  Lots of well designed crosswalks, streets/lanes.  It also has a lot of bike accidents.  According to SWITRS (California Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System), there were over 600 bike collisions in 2016.  That's an average of almost 2 a day!

So what does that look like?

We see a lot of red around Downtown/Market St.  But are there a lot of collisions because it's actually more risky?
Or is it because there are a lot of bikes running through that area?

As mentioned earlier, collision data is readily available through the statewide system.  Bike volume, not so much.  The traditional way of gathering that data is by standing at intersections and counting how many bikes passed by.

Thankfully, there is Strava - it's like Facebook for athletes.  Users record where and when they've gone on bike rides.

It's not an exact match of actual bike volume, but it's a reasonable proxy.  Certainly more representative than bike-share data.

Each one of these blue points is a route where Strava users have recorded hundreds or thousands of trips

I focused on the northeastern part of SF where almost all collisions occur.  I divided it into grid squares - in each square, I matched the collisions with the bike volume.

So there's a lot of bike activity on the periphery and middle.  On the strict collision count map earlier, the middle was very red, but we see that there are a lot of bikes going through there.

Putting collisions and volume together - that area in downtown/Market is actually not too bad.  It's actually the south part of the Mission district that's not so good.  (1 collision in about 50 Strava rides) I don't think there is enough data to zoom in even closer here.  It would be interesting to get commercial access to Strava's data (Strava Metro).
